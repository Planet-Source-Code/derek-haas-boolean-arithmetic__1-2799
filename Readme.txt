Boolean ops

This program includes functions for performing Boolean (bitwise) AND, OR, and XOR; as well as left shift, right shift, and one's complement.  Right now, the subroutines are set up to use the values in the textboxes and output the results to another text box.  However, you can easily modify them to take passed variables and return the results as a function.
